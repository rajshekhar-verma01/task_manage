## Setup Requirements

1. **Node.js** installed on your Windows machine
2. **Development server running**: `npm run dev` (on port 5000)
3. **Electron installed**: Should be automatic with `npx electron`

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to find electron app"
- âœ… Fixed with `electron-package.json` configuration
- Use `launch-with-config.cjs` which handles this automatically

### Blank screen
- âœ… Fixed with server connection retry logic
- App waits for development server before loading

### Database errors
- âœ… Fixed with JSON database (no native dependencies)
- Data stored in user-friendly JSON format

### Development server not responding
- Make sure `npm run dev` is running
- Check http://localhost:5000 loads in browser

## Expected Launch Sequence

1. **Server Check**: Verifies development server is running
2. **Electron Start**: Opens 1400x900 window
3. **Connection Wait**: Waits for server to be ready (up to 10 retries)
4. **App Load**: Loads your React interface
5. **Database Init**: JSON database initializes
6. **DevTools Open**: For debugging (development mode)
7. **Ready**: Full task management functionality available

## Your Data Location

All your tasks, categories, and settings are saved in:
```
%APPDATA%/task-management-electron-app/taskflow-data.json
```

This is a human-readable JSON file that you can backup easily.

## Success Indicators
